# Plan
This is a todo list mcp server written in golang. It should use module github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk.

Check this example written in rust at examples/todo.rs. This project should match the functionality of that one.

For a working code example of how the mcp server should be written in golang, reference https://github.com/containers/kubernetes-mcp-server

Please create a plan write out the details steps needed to the new file TODO.md then begin implementing. Be sure to use your agent tool for help or more information gathering.

## Example Usage

In this example, this demonstrates how the Todo extension helps goose stay organized when working through systematic improvements.
